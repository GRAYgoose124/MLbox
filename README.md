# Diffusion Box
A test playground for Stable Diffusion, personal utilities to make life easier.

Uses many examples and code from https://huggingface.co/.
Probably inherits CreativeML Open RAIL-M licensing.

## Installing
Clone the repo, then `poetry install`, preferably inside a venv.

## Running
The `diffuser` executable has multiple cmd flags, it uses a standard argparser, so check `-h`.
